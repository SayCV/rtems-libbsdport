These notes are sketchy at best and reflect Joel's working
knowledge.

ASSUME: Building from 4.10 CVS head. Absolutely required!!! for
        use on i386.

+ check out from CVS (you have done that)
+ bootstrap using bootstrap from RTEMS source
+ Build and install RTEMS BSPs of interest
+ Build libbsdport
mkdir build
cd build
../libbsdport/configure \
  --with-rtems-top=/home/joel/rtems-4.10-work/bsp-install/ \
  --prefix=/home/joel/rtems-4.10-work/bsp-install/ >c.log 2>&1 && \
  make >b.log 2>&1 && \
  make install  >i.log 2>&1 
echo $?

+ Build network demos for using the networkconfig-qemu.h in this
  directory as your networkconfig.h.  If you are not targeting a pc,
  you probably will have to drop off the ISA drivers in the configuration.

  Also the IP is hard-coded as 10.0.2.5 in the above network config.

+ Running on qemu:

qemu -no-reboot -m 128 -boot a -serial stdio \
  -net nic,macaddr=00:80:7F:22:61:77,model=rtl8139 \
  -net tap,vlan=0,script=/etc/qemu-ifup  \
  -fda ~joel/qemu/pc386_fda -hda fat:/home/joel/qemu/hd

I have an fda image in ftp under rtems/people/joel/qemu which autoboots
test.exe from hda.  Use that.  

The "NIC model" can be i82559er, rtl8139 or pcnet.  

+ On real hardware, do whatever it is you do.  Boot from floppy or net.
  Fix your configuration and report back.

HOW TO BUILD THE SSRL RTEMS-APPLICATIONS

$Id$

Till Straumann, 2008/10/3

***************************************************
THIS FILE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN YET, SORRY!

Some useful information regarding 'configure' options
can be found in cexp/INSTALL.

Basic instructions:

 - make sure PATH contains toolchain directory
 - mkdir build
 - chdir build
 - ../configure --with-rtems-top=/afs/slac/package/rtems/<version> \
                --prefix=/afs/slac/package/rtems/<version>
 - make
 - make install

This builds ssrlApps for all architectures/BSPs which are installed
under --with-rtems-top. The list of BSPs can be explicitly defined
using --with-rtemsbsp='bsp1 bsp2 bsp3 ...'.

The default installation path for binaries, libraries and includes is

 <prefix>/target/ssrlApps/<cpu>-rtems/<bsp>/bin
 <prefix>/target/ssrlApps/<cpu>-rtems/<bsp>/lib
 <prefix>/target/ssrlApps/<cpu>-rtems/<bsp>/include

but can be modified using the standard --exec-prefix, --libdir, --includedir
options (see 'configure' documentation and cexp/INSTALL).

Other useful options:

    --enable-std-rtems-installdirs
            Install directly into the RTEMS installation directories;
			by default a location *outside* of the standard location
			is used. If you don't use this option you can also fine-tune
			the installation using the usual --prefix, --exec-prefix,
			--libdir, --includedir etc. options. If you use this
			option '--prefix' & friends are effectively overridden.

	--with-hostbindir=<path>
			Where tools, i.e., programs that execute on the development
			platform are to be installed. Defaults to

			   PREFIX/host/${build_alias}/bin
